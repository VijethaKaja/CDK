Algorithm for adding an element at last:
1.Traverse the linked list until next pointer becomes null
2.make the next pointer of last node point to item
3.make next pointer of item null
Algorithm for adding an element at First:
1.make the next pointer of item point to first element of linkedlist
Algorithm for adding an element after B:
1.traverse the linkedlist until you come across B
2.store the next node from B in a new node
3.make the next poiner of B point to E 
4.make the next pointer of E point to new node
Algorithm for removing an element:
1.traverse the linkedlist until you come across a node whose next node is to be removed
2.store the next node of object to be removed in new node
3.make the previous node point to the new node
